# Hello :)

Welcome to my profile!

I'm a Computer Science student at Stanford University.

I founded [Pocket Congress](https://sidmb.com/articles/pocket-congress), an iOS app that won the Congressional App Challenge. I'm currently working on [the software for a satellite launching into space next year](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-flight-software), among other projects. Learn more about me on [my website](https://sidmb.com) or send me an email.

Sincerely,
